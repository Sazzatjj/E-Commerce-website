Getting Started:


This repository primarily focuses on the frontend development of Cara. While some basic backend functionality (e.g., form submission) might be included, more advanced features like secure user accounts, product databases, and payment processing will require additional backend development using technologies like Node.js, Python, or PHP. There may be notes or placeholders within the code to guide further backend implementation.
